### @color[white](Plan S)

###### @color[white](4 February 2019)

Note: There will be a Plan S meeting at ITC on March 13. This is just a first slideset to structure my ideas and collect feedback

---
### What is Plan S?
@ul
- It is an initiative of cOallition S, a consortium of 12 EU countries launched by the ERC. It promotes OA publishing.

- It requires publishing in open repositories or in journals that are available to all by Jan 1, 2020.
@ulend

---
### Principles#1 
@ul
- authors should retain copyright on their publications, which must be published under an open license;
- the members of the coalition should establish robust criteria and requirements for compliant OA journals and platforms;
- they should also provide incentives for the creation of compliant OA journals and platforms if they do not yet exist;
@ulend 

---
### Principles#2 
@ul
- publication fees should be covered by the funders or universities, not individual researchers;
- such publication fees should be standardized and capped;
- universities, research organizations, and libraries should align their policies and strategies;
- for books and monographs, the timeline may be extended beyond 2020;
@ulend 

---
### Principles#3 
@ul 
- open archives and repositories are acknowledged for their importance;
- hybrid open-access journals are not compliant with the key principle;
- members of the coalition should monitor and sanction non-compliance.

### Reactions - for profit publishers

Note: what happened to  paper encyclopedias? 

---
### Reactions - common sense 
cOAlition S strongly encourages that research data, preprints, and other research 
outputs are made openly accessible, subject to the usual legal and ethical 
considerations. 

cOAlition S supports the intentions of the San Francisco DORA that research needs to be  assessed on its own merits rather than on the basis of the venue in which the research is published.

### Reactions - common sense#2
There is a lack of explicit reference to data and code. The protocols for data management and for access to the data and code behind a publication are crucial for validating and reproducing research results. 

We encourage research organizations to support the management and open publishing of research data and code according to FAIR principles.

### Two scenarios
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br>

---
### Scenario#1
Jan 1, 2021
Plan S has led to mandatory Gold OA
Authors pay APC ~ 2500 Eur
Higher prices seem to indicate better quality
Researchers with money can pay those fees
Researchers without money struggle or cannot publish in OA journals
trade off publish with freedom to freedom to access publications
Smaller academic disciplines die out. They cannot publish in good journals, bad CV, no publication grants, specialized knowledge disappears.
Small scientific societies based on subscriptions disappear too
Predatory journals flourish because of attractive APC
pre-print repositories disappear leaving whole community in search of new ways to communicate and collaborate

---
### Scenario#1
Jan 1, 2023
Oligopoly of publishers with APC rising to more than 5K Eur
More and more (predatory) journals appear
Quality is not controlled. Quantity is more important for publishers
Private research use publications to advertize their work/product
European bodies are set to control predatory journals but cannot keep up with developments
Researchers are confused. Low trust in science
Young people are told not to become a scientist
We loose innovation. 
Humanities and social sciences get totally marginalized
The rest of the world does not follow plan S. How will EU and no-EU scientists collaborate?
Research collaboration suffers inside and outside EU
 

---
### Scenario#2
Jan 1, 2021
National and Transnational organizations support journals directly. Diamond OA 
Open Science is achieved because journals are open to readers and to researchers 
Diamond OA is paid with the money saved in APC
Journals funding is transparent and clear to everyone
Journals request funding for X years and their quality is peer reviewed 
Preprint services could either be an alternative or become a new-style journal 
The scientific community decides which journals to fund
No predatory journals
Publishers provide a service for a fee.
This creates a healthy competition among journals
Excessive profit by publishers disappear (Elsevier 40% profit!)
Focus on quality publications

---
### Scenario#2
Jan 1, 2023
Diamond OA journals with good reputation flourish
publish good research at no cost to authors. Readership increases
Researchers outside of EU decide to follow this path
A transition to OS means redesigning research evaluation 
(impact factor of journals vs. societal benefit)
