Note: There will be a Plan S meeting at ITC on March 13. This is just a first slideset to structure my ideas and collect feedback

### What is Plan S?
@ul
- It is an initiative of cOallition S, a consortium of 12 EU countries launched by the ERC. It promotes OA publishing.

- It requires publishing in open repositories or in journals that are available to all by Jan 1, 2020.
@ulend

---
### Principles#1 
@ul
- authors should retain copyright on their publications, which must be published under an open license;
- the members of the coalition should establish robust criteria and requirements for compliant OA journals and platforms;
- they should also provide incentives for the creation of compliant OA journals and platforms if they do not yet exist;
@ulend 

---
### Principles#2 
@ul
- publication fees should be covered by the funders or universities, not individual researchers;
- such publication fees should be standardized and capped;
- universities, research organizations, and libraries should align their policies and strategies;
- for books and monographs, the timeline may be extended beyond 2020;
@ulend 

---
### Principles#3 
@ul 
- open archives and repositories are acknowledged for their importance;
- hybrid open-access journals are not compliant with the key principle;
- members of the coalition should monitor and sanction non-compliance.

Note: what happened to  paper encyclopedias? 

---
### Reactions 
cOAlition S strongly encourages that research data, preprints, and other research 
outputs are made openly accessible, subject to the usual legal and ethical 
considerations. 

cOAlition S supports the intentions of the San Francisco DORA that research needs to be  assessed on its own merits rather than on the basis of the venue in which the research is published.

### Reactions 
There is a lack of explicit reference to data and code. The protocols for data management and for access to the data and code behind a publication are crucial for validating and reproducing research results. 

We encourage research organizations to support the management and open publishing of research data and code according to FAIR principles.
