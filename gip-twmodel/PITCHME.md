### GIP research interviews 
@ul
- Personal interviews with all GIP researchers 
- Collected insightful information and valuable suggestions 
- Keywords: focus, collaboration, team learning and technology 
@ulend

Note: I met all GIP researchers, including AIOs and PhD students. I got a lot of insightful information and valuable suggestions to improve GIP research. In the next slides I summarize my findings. The keywords of that summary are: focus, collaboration, team learning and technology

### GIP research: Focus 
@title[GIP_focus]
<div class="left">
![](gip-twmodel/figures/focus.jpeg)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>Too many topics! </li>
        <br>
        <li>how are we unique? </li>
        <br>
        <li>specialization domains? </li>
        <br>
        <li>Embedding of PhD topics? </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: we do too many things so much that, from the outside it looks like we are working hard to resemble other groups. or put in different words, we are fuzzyfying our scientific expertise and know-how. there is a widespread sense of lack of focus, lack of direction, lack of visibility that needs to be corrected. we need to be more clear about our uniqueness, our specialization domains and draw a GIP research landscape where our researchers and PhD candidates feel at home.

---
### GIP research: Collaborate 
@title[GIP_collaborations]
<div class="left">
![](gip-twmodel/figures/teamwork.jpg)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>Critical mass </li>
        <br>
        <li>Horizontal and vertical collaborations </li>
        <br>
        <li>Make use of (inter)national networks </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: Collaboration is needed to reach a critical mass to have impact, be meaningful and viable. Lots of GIP researchers, notably PhD candidates, feel isolated. Horizontal collaborations appear to be discouraged and researchers mostly talk to their neighbors or supervisors. 

---
### GIP research: Team learning   
@title[GIP_learning]
<div class="left">
![](gip-twmodel/figures/group.png)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>Write smart papers </li>
        <br>
        <li>Link research and education</li>
        <br>
        <li>PhD supervision: expertise and experience  </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note:this slide mostly contains suggestions to fix the lack of focus and collaboration. these suggestions were offered by GIP researchers. so we have a good level of introspection. we could brainstorm about key scientific domains and then decide to write together one or more SMART papers that will show our vision, put us in the spot light and serve as a road map for our departmental work. 
The second point goes beyond the classical message of first doing research and then reusing the material for education. in fact, the idea is to organize our research activity like we organize our education. A logical and coherent group of people are being given the task of organize a course. Experience shows that despite the lack of time, all of our courses run and are reasonably good. We can also organize a group of researchers, assign a generic topic and ask them to deliver a publication by a certain date. The third point combines complaints (PhD supervisors are not always experts in the research topic of the PhD student or lack supervision/project management experience) with a solution: always assign a group of supervisors to each PhD student. That promotes collaboration and, if done well, focus.

### GIP research: Technology    
@title[GIP_learning]
<div class="left">
![](gip-twmodel/figures/tech.jpg)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>GIP labs </li>
        <br>
        <li>Cloud computing</li>
        <br>
        <li>big geodata </li>
        <br>
        <li>ITC infrastructure</li>    
    </ul>
</div>

Note: We are interested in new technologies and set up two labs that could catalize some of our research work. Many GIP staff are interested in cloud computing, using and analyzing big data. Yet, we lack basic ICT infrastructure: we do not have a strategic plan or facility for large scale computing and to deploy applications and we have an 'static' GIP code repository that could play an important role in increasing our productivity and visibility.

### we are not alone 
@[GIP_ITC]

![](gip-twmodel/figures/matryoshka.jpg)

Note: GIP is part of ITC and ITC's research was recently evaluated. In the next slides I present the main findings of the mid-term visitation committee. 

---
### ITC research evaluation 
@ul
- ITC needs to set its own course and plan for its own future. Importantly, ITC needs to do this in 2019 and be forging a clear path to this future in time for the next full evaluation in 2021
<br>
<br>
- ITC departments need clear SMART research goals
@ulend

### ITC major improvement points
@ul[](false)
- A. Measure sucess of capacity building activities 
- B. Support strategies for people, education, infrastructure, etc.
- C. Awareness and convergence of ITC vision 
- D. Collective view of where we want to be in 5 years. 
- E. Improve PhD program. 
- F. Evaluate data management plan. 
- G. Enhance diversity: ethinicity, age, gender
@ulend

### Capacity building
ITC/GIP needs to show that our work is relevant to society
We need metrics to measure our capacity development activities

SDGs are used because there is an absence of vision. It is not hard to reverse engineer contribution to SDGs but do we want to focus on high level goals drafted by others? 


+++ 
### Capacity building

Accountability: We need a system to calibrate our success and to show it to others: funding organizations, etc. A portfolio of activities indicating goals and milestones is a pre-requisite to have a more accountable system.

Mode: Open educational resources. 
All materials should be made freely available in a central repository. We then get visibility and can broaden our impact. The value is not in the materials but in the quality of the teachers/trainers. Whenever possible, promote open source software solutions 

Create and support existing communities of practice. Keep in touch with them via social media or, even better, through our open educational platform.


+++
### Capacity building

Content: 
In the context of LLL, we need to develop a more up-to-date curriculum focusing on new developments and technologies (Geodata science, Python for geocomputing, etc). This curriculum is tailored WITH the help of the receiving organization (based on their needs). Again, engage with the organizations and individuals that we try to serve.

More TMT-like courses and direct - and hopefully long-term- engagement with certain organizations and/or countries so that we can define our accountability plan.


+++
### Supporting strategies
Vision, strategic plan, targets and milestones for ITC and for each of the departments

We need to review our strategic plan. 
GIP and ITC need a better defined strategy for IT infrastructure, big data/data science and open science. 

Key roles: GIP-ICT person, faculty investment on big data and knowledge hub (pre-print server)

Note: NWO has now signed the DORA declaration. Citations, h-indices and impact factors are not valid anymore. Impactful science is more important. Pre-prints and other scientific contributions will count in project evaluations 


+++
### Collective views 
Agree a clear and collective view of where colleagues would like ITC to be in say five yearsâ€™ time, a clear route map to get there (with targets) and the performance milestones to be reached along the way. This should build on ITCs strong values and, unless there is evidence to the contrary, be unconstrained by the goals of other organisations.

No comments. 

+++
### Improve PhD program. 
Analyse the characteristics of the current PhD system (recruitment, topic definition, supervision, evaluation) and create an action plan for PhD completions, with targets to achieve them.

### Twin-Win model
@title[T-W]

> Breakthrough theories and validated solutions for societal benefit

Breakthrough theories in published papers <br>
validated solutions ready for widespread dissemination 

Note: draw a gaussian and indicate that 10-20 % are either totally convinced or unconvinced. This presentation is for the rest.
there is growing body of literature that shows that there are new ways to do research. 
The ivory tower model is not as resilient as it looks like. 
we need to work on realistic problems and partner with professionals in business, government and NGOs 

--- 
### The ABC of research 
@ul
- Applied and Basic Combined
- Achieving Breakthroughs via Collaborations
- Always Build Connections
@ulend

### Bush was wrong

Linear model: basic research --> applied research --> commercial applications 

wicked problems is only partially correct.
multidisciplinarity is good but we need to also work with community partners rather than for them. These partners allow for validating the proposed theories and solutions
this is the path to high-impact research 

use-inspired research 
socially embedded 

Note: Vannevar Bush; Science: The Endless Frontier (1945); 


---
### Short-term S3 strategy 

Do something small soon. To boost confidence

@ul
- Invite external speakers (follow up)
- Organize a (weekly) reading group (impact on your work)
- Organize a small workshop (SENSE)
- Organize regular tutorials (Hands-on sessions) 
- Work on meaningful problems: BMGF grand challenges, NWA,... 
@ulend

Note: Follow up a day latter to encourage collaboration. how might this publication change your research? what did the author fail to do? what new directions does this paper open up? Send summary to those that could not participate.

### A Team 
@title[A-team]
<div class="left">
![](gip-twmodel/figures/Ateam.jpg)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>No superheroes</li>
        <br>
        <li>GIP and ITC's diversity</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: I do not want superheroes. We should make use of GIP's and ITC's diversity to create our own A teams....  

---
### GIP research project
@ul[](false)
- Crowdsource a couple of "GIP megaprojects" (Large "umbrella" projects connected to at least 3 out of the 5 GIP domains and that has real partners -- industry, NGOs, etc)
- GIP researchers and PhD students work on these project together with problem-owners. 
@ulend

---
### GIP research project
@ul[](false)
- MSc topics are derived from these projects. We promote horizontal collaborations by, for instance, having than 1 researcher/student working on the same topic and dataset but then looking at the problem from different perspectives (5 GIP sub-domains).
- Workout the waterfall model and connect our work vertically and horizontally 
@ulend

---
### GIP research projects
@ul  
- Early stage: start with a scoping study to better define the topic (literature review + dataset pre-processing)
- Middle stage:  Develop geoinformation products/service. Geovisualizations, IT infrastructure, models, etc
- Long-term: Actionable information used in further publications. Identify new (related) problems
