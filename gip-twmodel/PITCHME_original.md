### GIP research interviews 

- Personal interviews with all GIP researchers 
- Insightful and valuable information
- Keywords: focus, collaboration, team learning and technology 

Note: I met all GIP researchers, including AIOs and PhD students. I got a lot of insightful information and valuable suggestions to improve GIP research. In the next slides I summarize my findings. The keywords of that summary are: focus, collaboration, team learning and technology 

---
### GIP research: Focus 
@title[GIP_focus]
<div class="left">
![](/figures/.jpg)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>Too many topics! </li>
        <br>
        <li>how are we unique? </li>
        <br>
        <li>specialization domains? </li>
        <br>
        <li>Embedding of PhD topics? </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: we do too many things so much that, from the outside it looks like we are working hard to resemble other groups. or put in different words, we are fuzzyfying our scientific expertise and know-how. there is a widespread sense of lack of focus, lack of direction, lack of visibility that needs to be corrected. we need to be more clear about our uniqueness, our specialization domains and draw a GIP research landscape where our researchers and PhD candidates feel at home.

---
### GIP research: Collaborate 
@title[GIP_collaborations]
<div class="left">
![](/figures/.jpg)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>Critical mass </li>
        <br>
        <li>Horizontal and vertical collaborations </li>
        <br>
        <li>Make use of (inter)national networks </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: Collaboration is needed to reach a critical mass to have impact, be meaningful and viable. Lots of GIP researchers, notably PhD candidates, feel isolated. Horizontal collaborations appear to be discouraged and researchers mostly talk to their neighbors or supervisors. 

---
### GIP research: Team learning   
@title[GIP_learning]
<div class="left">
![](/figures/.jpg)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>Write smart papers </li>
        <br>
        <li>Link research and education</li>
        <br>
        <li>PhD supervision: expertise and experience  </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note:this slide mostly contains suggestions to fix the lack of focus and collaboration. these suggestions were offered by GIP researchers. so we have a good level of introspection. we could brainstorm about key scientific domains and then decide to write together one or more SMART papers that will show our vision, put us in the spot light and serve as a road map for our departmental work. 
The second point goes beyond the classical message of first doing research and then reusing the material for education. in fact, the idea is to organize our research activity like we organize our education. A logical and coherent group of people are being given the task of organize a course. Experience shows that despite the lack of time, all of our courses run and are reasonably good. We can also organize a group of researchers, assign a generic topic and ask them to deliver a publication by a certain date. The third point combines complaints (PhD supervisors are not always experts in the research topic of the PhD student or lack supervision/project management experience) with a solution: always assign a group of supervisors to each PhD student. That promotes collaboration and, if done well, focus. 

---
### GIP research: Technology    
@title[GIP_learning]
<div class="left">
![](/figures/.jpg)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>GIP labs </li>
        <br>
        <li>Cloud computing</li>
        <br>
        <li>big geodata </li>
        <br>
        <li>ITC infrastructure</li>    
    </ul>
</div>

Note: We are interested in new technologies and set up two labs that could catalize some of our research work. Many GIP staff are interested in cloud computing, using and analyzing big data. Yet, we lack basic ICT infrastructure: we do not have a strategic plan or facility for large scale computing and to deploy applications and we have an 'static' GIP code repository that could play an important role in increasing our productivity and visibility.

### we are not alone 
@[GIP_ITC]
matrioska 

Note: GIP is part of ITC and ITC's research was recently evaluated. In the next slides I present the main findings of the mid-term visitation committee. 

---
### ITC research evaluation 

```AsciiDoc 
ITC needs to set its own course and plan for its own future. Importantly, ITC needs to do this in 2019 and be forging a clear path to this future in time for the next full evaluation in 2021.
```

```AsciiDoc 
ITC departments need clear SMART research goals
```

### Twin-Win model
@title[T-W]

Note: draw a gaussian and indicate that 10-20 % are either totally convinced or unconvinced. This presentation is for the rest.
there is growing body of literature that shows that there are new ways to do research. 
The ivory tower model is not as resilient as it looks like. 
we need to work on realistic problems and partner with professionals in business, government and NGOs

### publishing together
University of Maryland.
type of publication| average citations
Single author | 3 
colleagues from campus | 6.1 
colleagues from US | 9.2 
colleagues from abroad | 13.9

Note: study done using SCOPUS

### Bush was wrong (again)
Vannevar Bush
Science: The Endless Frontier (1945)
linear model: basic research --> applied research --> commercial applications 

wicked problems is only partially correct.
multidisciplinarity is good but we need to also work with community partners rather than for them. These partners allow for validating the proposed theories and solutions
this is the path to high-impact research 


use-inspired research 
socially embedded 

---
### Next practical steps

upcoming MSc Fair 
prepare "megaproject description": large umbrella project that includes know-how and knowledge from at least 3 out of the 5 GIP domains and that has partners (industry, NGOs, etc)

Multiple staff members and PhD students work on such a project together with problem-owners. MSc topics are derived from this project.

Horizontal views/collaborations: let more than 1 student work on the same topic (and dataset) but then looking at the problem from a different perspective (5 sub-domains).

workout the waterfall model: cool visualization and story 

---
### stages of research 
Early stage:  Scoping study that helps define the topic, gets a dataset or does an extensive literature review (6 to 9 months. PhD qualifier style)
Middle stage:  New software tools or models
Long-term: Actionable information used in further publications. Identify new (related) problems   
 
---
### Bottom-up
spread the word in small groups of about 20 people
give everyone the chance to talk 
collect evidences
prepare a manifesto for newcomers to the group

and at some point we need a top-down approach.
Research communicator prize: share research and discuss his/her research with the public so that staff members see that there is life beyond publications. Other research outcomes are as important as publications. 


Note: Lorne Whitehead. See email example on pages 31-21

### the ABC of research 
applied and basic combined
achieving breakthrough collaborations
always build connections

---
### small/short-term
s3: something small soon. To boost confidence
- invite a speaker. Follow up a day latter speaker and audience to encourage that they pursue their collaboration plans
- reading group: weekly. how might this change your research? what did the author fail to do? what new directions does this paper open up? Send summary to those that could not participante.
- organize a small workshop (even if that is only 1/2 day)
- organize a tutorial. Hands-on. 
- study meaningful problems: BMGF grand challenges. NWA research agenda. SDG

### GIP goal 
@title[GIP_goal]

```AsciiDoc
GIP develops methods and techniques to produce actionable geo-information 
that supports knowledge generation and/or decision-making 
with a focus on societal problems that deal with changes in space, place, and time.
```

Note: forgot because of holidays. this is what we do. We work on methods and techniques for ST analysis by integrating knowledge and know-how from 
geography, engineering, CS and other scientific domains and we want to use those methods and techniques to contribute to solving socially-relevant problems.

---
### GIP domains 
@title[GIP_domains]
![GIP](phr/figures/GIP_new.PNG)

Note: and here we have a couple of graphical representations of our work. On the left we see the GIP can be placed in the triangle formed by Geo, CS/digital humanities and applications. Nowadays with a strong emphasis on the SDGs and big data. On the right we see the 5 domains of GIP and how problems can "circulate" across them in various ways until a proper solution is found (or better to be able to find a proper solution).

### Facilitate research work

*Failing to plan is planning to fail*

@ul
- What are your short-term plans? @size[75%]((publications, projects,...))
- Is there anything preventing you from realizing those plans? @size[75%]((time, staff development,...))
- Do you have suggestions or ideas to improve (y)our research activity? @size[75%]((anything :-))
@ulend
 
Note: publications, research projects, collaborations, etc.
I will ask Jolanda to schedule research FJUTs with all staff members having and O in their Dutch work profile. I would like to organize a common meeting with AIOs (and another one with our PhD students). To mostly discus the 2nd and the 3rd questions.

### Promote integration of talents 
@title[integration]
<div class="left">
![](phr/figures/teamwork.jpg)

</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>Heterogeneous group: GIP resilience :-) </li>
        <br>
        <li>‎Complex & wicked problems: expertise and know-how from various disciplines</li>
        <br>
        <li>Herding cats</li>
        <br>
        <li>Deeper integration: leading to more internal collaborations and a stronger research focus</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: GIP is a heterogeneous department and that gives us quite some resilience (to use a current buzzword). Our heterogeneity allow us to work on complex and wicked problems and at the same time makes management activities a bit hard (herding cats). I think that one way to mitigate this issue is to work  on a deeper integration. Promoting internal collabs and trying to pursue a common and strong research focus.

### Promote integration of talents 
@title[Integration_personal]

- *Analytics group*: discuss research problems, ideas, scientific tools, code, etc. 

@ul
- *Geovis group*: emails, meetings at the geovislab, combinination of staff, MSc and PhD students, etc.

- *GIP research meetings*: share ideas with full dept.

@ulend

Note: Several years ago, i believe 4 or so, i started to organize lunch meetings. the idea was to share knowledge. we created code repositories and, for instance, used Slack as an alternative channel to email during my sabbatical. Then Menno-Jan and Yuri started with th e geovis group and, of course, we have our GIP research meetings. Valia is working on giving them a new style.  

+++
### Promote integration of talents 
@title[Integration_personal#2]

Open proposals:
@ul
- Monthly Monday Morning Meeting or 4Ms (per theme?)
- Review our GIP research page and our PURE website 
- Apply the *living text book* concept to all GIP researchers (or edit PURE keywords)
- Your ideas? 
@ulend

Note: these meetings are probably not enough. they are short. Hence I propose having somewhat longer meetings where EVERYONE presents what he/she does in say 10-15 mins. we could also have a dedicated session to update our research profile in the GIP website and to organize our PURE website.
