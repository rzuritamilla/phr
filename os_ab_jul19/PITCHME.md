Note: These little domestic animals should reminds us everyday that the Anthropocene is a reality.

### The broiler chicken 

@ul
- We have doubled its body size, and achieved a fivefold increase in body mass.

- The skeletal morphology, pathology, bone geochemistry and genetics are demonstrably different to those of their ancestors 

- Broiler chickens, now unable to survive without human intervention, have a combined mass exceeding that of all other birds on Earth.

Note: Changes in breeding, diet and farming practices

Note: Broiler chickens symbolize the unprecedented and human-led reconfiguration of the Earth's biosphere.  We changed the chicken, and are changing our planet. Now it is time to change our approach to science and scholarship. We need to dare to lead the revolution towards open science. No chickens, no excuse.

@size[65%](DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2)

Note: This revolution is needed because we live in an impasse. In the past, the costs of publishing were very high. The printing press changed this and, in a way, led to establishment of the scientific journals. Now internet and a change in societal rules are asking scientists to change the way the do science.

@size[65%](DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-00026-8_2)
Note: Presently we only care about positive results, and we only start thinking about disseminating them in our publication phase. Open science principles support the dissemination of both positive and negative results from the very beginning. Moreover, our results are not only disseminated in the form of papers, but also of blogs, social media posts, code release, online discussions, etc.

Note: this change allows moving faster, and connecting with others and with other research lines so that we can solve more complicated issues.

### Move towards open science

![](phr/figures/OpenScience_v45.png)

Note: Thus far, I haven't defined open science because it is difficult to do so. For many people open science is an umbrella term that contains ....   Source of figure --> https://blogs.plos.org/neuro/2018/01/31/open-science-sharing-is-caring-but-is-privacy-theft-by-david-mehler-and-kevin-weiner/

### Move towards open science 
![](os_ab_jul19/figures/individual_vs_family.jpg)

Note: At ITC that umbrella is hold by multiple individuals and I would like to see a shift from individuals to institutions so that the full ITC family falls under the open science umbrella.

Note: Open science has been studied from 5 different perspectives or schools of thought. In the next slides, I review these schools so that we can explore what fits best our faculty.

### Infrastructure school
@title[infrastructure]
<div class="left">
![](os_ab_jul19/figures/infrastructure_school.JPG)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
    		<br>
        <li>ITC-wide big geodata platform </li>
        <br>
        <li>‎Pre-print service / Knowledge hub </li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: Knowledge hub open to others so that they can see our data (FAIR data, not necessary open data), code and toolboxes. Our research output should not only have social impact but it should be rigorous. What a better way to show the latter than to share all the elements linked to the scientific enterprise instead of just sharing PDF files?

### Public school
@title[public]
<div class="left">
![](os_ab_jul19/figures/public_school.JPG)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
    		<br>
        <li>Faculty prize for communicating science</li>
        <br>
        <li>‎ Work with problem owners on real-life problems</li>
        <br>
        <li>Crowdsource problems, data and data analysis</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: We need to make science accessible to the public and so i plea for a new faculty prize on science communication. For me citizen science also means that we need to work with problem owners on real life problems. our science should lead to technological breakthroughs but also to solutions that can be deployed in the field. This also means that we could do more to connect with society and with the global south, we could crowd-source the definition of problems, data collection and data analysis.

### Measurement school
@title[measurement]
<div class="left">
![](os_ab_jul19/figures/measurement_school.JPG)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
    		<br>
        <li>Forget tyranny of metrics</li>
        <br>
        <li>Top 5 contributions to science</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reward re-use of data and code</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: we need to forget the tyranny of the metrics. we need to start asking our colleagues to report what their top 5 contributions to science are.. and those could be a video, a news item, a dataset, etc. we also need to actively reward the re-use of data and code. ITC should be proud of having its data and code used elsewhere.

### Democratic school
@title[democratic]
<div class="left">
![](os_ab_jul19/figures/democratic_school.JPG)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
    		<br>
        <li>Open access publishing</li>
        <br>
        <li>FAIR data / Open code</li>
        <br>
        <li>Open educational resources</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: we need to warranty access to our findings. This demands a proactive attitude towards open access publishing. The pre-print server/knowledge hub mentioned above could be a good way to go because it could help to make our data more FAIR and to open op our code. I also think that ITC should move release all of our educational resources for free in an open educational platform that would be a great contribution to our capacity development efforts and that would show that our value is not in materials in that can be found in internet but our human capital and know-how.

### Pragmatic school
@title[pragmatic]
<div class="left">
![](os_ab_jul19/figures/pragmatic_school.JPG)
</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
    		<br>
        <li>Communities of Practice</li>
        <br>
        <li>Promote team science</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reproducible and well-triangulated science</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: Sharing our educational material and scientific output is not enough. ITC should create and support CoP that use and expand those materials and outputs. We need to promote team science and intensively work with our partners. This will lead to a new ITC, a faculty that will be a hub of geospatial data, code and reproducible and well-triangulated scientific knowledge.

### Move towards open science 
@title[goal_today]
> Not every end is a goal <br>
> The end of a melody is not a goal <br>
> @size[70%](F. Nietzsche)

Note: I would like to close this presentation with a personal reflection. I do not think that open science should be seen as an end goal. Not every end is a goal. The end of a melody is not a goal. we need to enjoy the melody and our transition towards open science. we are doing well but we can do better. Just think for a second. what can you do today to make your science more open?
