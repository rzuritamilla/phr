Note: this little domestic animal reminds us everyday that the anthropocene is a reality.

### The broiler chicken 

Human-directed changes in breeding, diet and farming practices have at least doubled its body size from the late medieval period to the present, achieved a fivefold increase in body mass since the mid-twentieth century. 

The skeletal morphology, pathology, bone geochemistry and genetics of modern broilers are demonstrably different to those of their ancestors. 

Broiler chickens, now unable to survive without human intervention, have a combined mass exceeding that of all other birds on Earth; 

Note: This novel morphotype symbolizes the unprecedented human reconfiguration of the Earth's biosphere. https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.180325

### No chickens 

Note: if we changed our planet, we can also change our way of doing, disseminating and valuing science. Let's not be chicken and dare to lead this new revolution

### Move towards open science 
@title[OpenScience]
![](phr/figures/OpenScience.png)

Note: we have a GIP code repository. let's use it. we have interesting datasets. lets's share them. Many of us have interest in reproducible science. Let's do it and let's start today.
