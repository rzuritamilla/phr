Note: I would like to start this presentations with chickens. Broiler chickens. These little domestic animals should reminds us everyday that the Anthropocene is a reality.

### The broiler chicken 

@ul
- We have doubled its body size, and achieved a fivefold increase in body mass.

- The skeletal morphology, pathology, bone geochemistry and genetics are demonstrably different to those of their ancestors 

- Broiler chickens, now unable to survive without human intervention, have a combined mass exceeding that of all other birds on Earth.

Note: This novel morphotype symbolizes the unprecedented human reconfiguration of the Earth's biosphere. Changes in breeding, diet and farming practices have at least - The skeletal morphology, pathology, bone geochemistry and genetics of modern broilers are demonstrably different to those of their ancestors.

Note: it is clear that we, human beings, changed the chicken, and that we are changing our planet. Now it is time to change our approach to science and scholarship. We need to dare to lead this revolution. No more chickens.

Note: a scientific revolution is possible because we now have internet and have the means to publish our findings in a way that is accessible to everyone

    </ul>
</div>

Note: knowledge hub open to others so that they can see our data (FAIR data, not necessary open data), code and toolboxes.ITC's science should not only have impact but it should also be rigurous. what a better way to show the latter than to share all the elements linked to the scientific enterprise instead of just sharing a personal copy of a PDF?
