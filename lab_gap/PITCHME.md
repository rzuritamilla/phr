### @color[white](Lab Gap)
###### @color[white](R. Zurita-Milla)
###### @color[white](20 December 2018) 

Note: With Valia we just looked back at our research meetings. In this short presentation I will look at the broader scientific community and the tensions that seem to be bubbling across the world.

@title[intro]

Note: Researchers are typically good observers, but many seem to have trouble spotting the problems right under their noses. Those who run labs have a much rosier picture of the dynamics in their research groups than the one perceived by the working floor.

### Perception gap at GIP?
Do we need to worry?

Note: I am not sure, but it is never bad to raise awareness.
so Valia and I designed a small exercise, or better said, a game to discover or make more explicit what we do in our research time.

### Significance statements

Note: Significance  Statement.
  Authors  must  submit  a  120-word-
maximum  statement  about  the  significance  of  their  research  
paper  written  at  a  level  understandable  to  an  undergraduate-
educated  scientist  outside  their  field  of  specialty.  The  primary  
goal of the Significance Statement is to explain the relevance of 
the  work  in  broad  context  to  a  broad  readership. (https://blog.pnas.org/iforc.pdf)

### GIP goal 
@title[GIP_goal]

```AsciiDoc
GIP develops methods and techniques to produce actionable geo-information 
that supports knowledge generation and/or decision-making 
with a focus on societal problems that deal with changes in space, place, and time.
```

Note: forgot because of holidays. this is what we do. We work on methods and techniques for ST analysis by integrating knowledge and know-how from 
geography, engineering, CS and other scientific domains and we want to use those methods and techniques to contribute to solving socially-relevant problems.

### GIP domains 
@title[GIP_domains]
![GIP](phr/figures/GIP_new.PNG)

Note: and here we have a couple of graphical representations of our work. On the left we see the GIP can be placed in the triangle formed by Geo, CS/digital humanities and applications. Nowadays with a strong emphasis on the SDGs and big data. On the right we see the 5 domains of GIP and how problems can "circulate" across them in various ways until a proper solution is found (or better to be able to find a proper solution).

### My role as PHR
@title[PHR]
@ol
- Facilitate research work
- Promote integration of talents 
- Move towards open science
@olend
Note: as PHR, I would like to focus on 1, 2 and 3, and in the coming slides i briefly sketch ideas. These ideas are,  of course, open for discussion and your feedback is very much welcomed!

### Facilitate research work

        <li>Central point: Staff, PhD and MSc research </li>
        <br>
        <li>‎Link to GIP MT and FMT: strategy and research proposals </li>
        <br>
        <li>Support everyone to do their best: GIP website, sounding board </li>

Note: Corné (MSc research), Valia (GIP research meetings)
MT: strategic decisions and FMT for NWO proposals, for instance
use of website to share tips, funny news and articles that can help you with your research.

### Facilitate research work

*Failing to plan is planning to fail*

@ul
- What are your short-term plans? @size[75%]((publications, projects,...))
- Is there anything preventing you from realizing those plans? @size[75%]((time, staff development,...))
- Do you have suggestions or ideas to improve (y)our research activity? @size[75%]((anything :-))
@ulend
 
Note: publications, research projects, collaborations, etc.
I will ask Jolanda to schedule research FJUTs with all staff members having and O in their Dutch work profile. I would like to organize a common meeting with AIOs (and another one with our PhD students). To mostly discus the 2nd and the 3rd questions.

### Promote integration of talents 
@title[integration]
<div class="left">
![](phr/figures/teamwork.jpg)

</div>
<div class="right">
    <ul>
        <li>Heterogeneous group: GIP resilience :-) </li>
        <br>
        <li>‎Complex & wicked problems: expertise and know-how from various disciplines</li>
        <br>
        <li>Herding cats</li>
        <br>
        <li>Deeper integration: leading to more internal collaborations and a stronger research focus</li>
    </ul>
</div>

Note: GIP is a heterogeneous department and that gives us quite some resilience (to use a current buzzword). Our heterogeneity allow us to work on complex and wicked problems and at the same time makes management activities a bit hard (herding cats). I think that one way to mitigate this issue is to work  on a deeper integration. Promoting internal collabs and trying to pursue a common and strong research focus.

### Promote integration of talents 
@title[Integration_personal]

- *Analytics group*: discuss research problems, ideas, scientific tools, code, etc. 

@ul
- *Geovis group*: emails, meetings at the geovislab, combinination of staff, MSc and PhD students, etc.

- *GIP research meetings*: share ideas with full dept.

@ulend

Note: Several years ago, i believe 4 or so, i started to organize lunch meetings. the idea was to share knowledge. we created code repositories and, for instance, used Slack as an alternative channel to email during my sabbatical. Then Menno-Jan and Yuri started with th e geovis group and, of course, we have our GIP research meetings. Valia is working on giving them a new style.  

+++
### Promote integration of talents 
@title[Integration_personal#2]

Open proposals:
@ul
- Monthly Monday Morning Meeting or 4Ms (per theme?)
- Review our GIP research page and our PURE website 
- Apply the *living text book* concept to all GIP researchers (or edit PURE keywords)
- Your ideas? 
@ulend

Note: these meetings are probably not enough. they are short. Hence I propose having somewhat longer meetings where EVERYONE presents what he/she does in say 10-15 mins. we could also have a dedicated session to update our research profile in the GIP website and to organize our PURE website.

### Move towards open science

        <li>Reproducible and well-triangulated science</li>
        <br>
        <li> Share experiences and tools: Mendeley groups, @fa[github] </li>
    </ul>
</div>
Note: we have a GIP code repository. let's use it. we have interesting datasets. lets's share them. Many of us have interest in reproducible science. Let's do it and let's start today.

Note: Just think for a second. what can you do today to make your science more open?

Note: and there are 5 schools of thought. we can join them or learn from them and explore what fits best our work and our department.

You might say I'm a dreamer<br>

But I'm not the only one<br>
    
I hope some day you'll join us<br>
    
and the world will be as one<br>

Note: many new ideas and some of you might be thinking that i am a dreamer but i am not the only one!
