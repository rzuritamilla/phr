Note: With Valia we just looked back at our research meetings. In this short presentation I will look at the broader scientific community and the tensions that seem to be bubbling across the world. This presentation is heavily based on "Some hard numbers on science’s leadership problems; doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05143-8"

@title[intro]

Note: Researchers are typically good observers, but many have trouble observing the problems that appear right under their noses. Head of departments and research administrator usually have a much rosier picture of the dynamics in their research groups than the picture perceived by the working floor.

@title[Words_matter] 

Note: PI vs non-PIs and the group of most discontent people. These results were extracted from a survey done by Nature with more than 3,200 scientists.
Only 14% of PIs use negative words when describing their group.

@title[Perception_gap]

Note: there is clear gap between managers and the actual workforce. 
The gap is about 30% in all the dimensions. Summarize research projects, being available, checking experiments and doing proper data quality and data curation.
Perception gaps are not only happening in academia but also in our daily lives.

@title[perils]

Note: IPSOS just published a report on the perils of perception. People from 32 countries were interviewed on a variety of topics: Environment, crime, sexual behaviour, etc. Here I will focus on environmental issues.

@title[joke_ES_NL]
Note: people from different countries were asked the following question...
Incidentally, this figure also shows that Spain can lead positive rankings too and that the perception of climate change in NL is not very good. Something for Javier to discuss with Rutte next time that they meet in Colombia.

@title[Factors_to_fix] 
Note: now back to academia again, the perception gap is also visible in the list of items that should be "fixed" according to various groups.
PIs care about KPI and management
Non-PIs about their work-life balance and the (unfair) way in which their work is valued/evaluated
Discontent researchers complaint about mentoring and management skills of people higher up in the hierarchy. if you want to know more about this, you can check Dilbert :-)

### Perception gap at GIP?
![](lab_gap/figures/Mind_the_gap.jpg) 

Note: Do we need to worry? I am not sure,but it is never bad to raise awareness.
so Valia and I designed a small exercise, or better said, a game to discover or make more explicit what we do in our research time.

### Rules of the game
@ul
- Open the paper you got and check the name of the GIP colleague assigned to you.
- Write down the following information about him/her: 
	- Specialization area @size[66%]((e.g. methods/application domain)) 
	- Professional unique characteristic 
	- @color[red](**words in the list of tabu terms cannot be used!**)
- Fold the paper and put it back in the lottery pot
