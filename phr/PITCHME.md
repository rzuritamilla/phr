### GIP goal 
@title[GIP_goal]

```AsciiDoc
GIP develops methods and techniques to produce actionable geo-information 
that supports knowledge generation and/or decision-making 
with a focus on societal problems that deal with changes in space, place, and time.
```

Note: We work on socially-relevant problems that require the integration of know-how and expertise from multiple domains. These domains include geography, engineering and CS & we focus on methods and techniques for spatio-temporal analysis
